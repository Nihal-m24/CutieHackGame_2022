>Citrus Invaders is a space indaver game with a UCR twist. It is coded in Python using PyGame, PyCharm and Replit.

## Inspiration
As fairly new programmers and fairly experienced gamers, we wanted to try and implement a classic Space Invaders clone with the resources at our disposal.

## What it does
Essentially the program allows users to launch and play an interactive, GUI based Space Invaders clone.

## How we built it
We coded in python as well as using Pygame: a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

## Challenges we ran into
Going into the hackathon, Â¾ of us had never coded in Python before. Implementing fluid and consistently random movement for the enemy as well as the asteroids proved to be quite challenging. Also, we had issues with version control as we ended up only being able to use Repl.it for collaborative coding.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we even have a working, running, deliverable copy of the game. Additionally, the smooth movements of all objects instantiated as well as the hit detection were very satisfying to figure out.

## What we learned
We all improved and worked on our Python coding ability. Additionally, we also learned how to work as a team efficiently for short periods of time.

## What's next for Citrus Invaders
This was simply an exploratory experience for all of us, and going forwards we would like to continue to work on various new and exciting projects that we can learn.
